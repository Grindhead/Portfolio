THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION.
MOST THINGS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
THE CODE IS A MESS, I'M WORKING ON IT.

### `pnpm start` - to run

### `pnpm test` - to test

### `pnpm build` - to build

### `pnpm createPosts` - This will create dummy posts on the server

### `pnpm deployFunctions` - This will deploy the firebase functions to firebase. Remember to change your project ID

### `pnpm resizeImages` - This will resize the images in the public folder. The paths array in scripts/resizeImages.js should be updated with the paths of the images to be resized.
